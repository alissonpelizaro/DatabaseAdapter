This is a flexible system that allows seamless migration between different databases without disrupting the operation of your application. It functions as an intermediary layer between your `models` and `controllers` (or `business logic`), responsible for interpreting queries and orchestrating them for the desired database.

The aim of this project is to provide a simplified solution for handling database changes, ensuring that the migration process is as smooth as possible. This provides greater flexibility and scalability to the system, allowing it to easily adapt to different database requirements and demands.

In this code, you will find an example of an application capable of migrating between MySQL and MongoDB, demonstrating how the application's functionality can be maintained without compromising data integrity.
No código estou simulando uma aplicação que é capaz de migrar entre MySQL de MongoDB sem quebrar sua funcionalidade.

## Run the exmaple:
To test the example, use the following command: 
```
php adapter.php
```
